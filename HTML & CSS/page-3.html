      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a student at Tunga Impact Academy with experience in HTML, CSS,
        React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, SQLite, and Python. I have a
        passion for web development and learned to code through Udemy courses. I
        have worked on various projects that demonstrate my skills in web
        development. I am eager to continue learning and contributing to
        exciting new projects.

        <h3>THE WILD OASIS</h3>
        <p>
          This project focused on a hotel guest check-in and check-out solution.
          We built it as the final major project in my Jonas Schmedtmann React
          Udemy course. We leveraged technologies such as Tanstack React-Query,
          Supabase, Recharts, Styled-Component and more. Through this project, I
          learned how to manage remote state, work with charts, implement user
          authentication (login and logout), and add dark mode and light mode to
          a web application using the context API. Below is a screen shot of the
          dependencies and devDependencies used.

        <h3>FAST REACT PIZZA CO.</h3>
        <p>
          This project focused on a pizza customer order solution, built as part
          of the Jonas Schmedtmann React Udemy course. We leveraged technologies
          such as React-Redux, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and more. Through
          this project, I learned how to manage state globally using Redux,
          allowing components to access and update state efficiently, including
          how to work with state across different components without directly
          passing it between parent and child components. Below is a screen shot
          of the dependencies and devDependencies used.

        <h3>SNOW</h3>
        <p>
          This project is a presentation web app that displays cryptocurrency
          market movements and the dominance of crypto pairs. It builds upon the
          skills I developed in the 'Wild Oasis' project and leverages the
          Coinranking REST API for managing remote state, incorporating similar
          features. Working on this app helped me solidify concepts that I
          hadn't fully grasped during the 'Wild Oasis' project. Below is a
          screenshot of the dependencies and devDependencies used.

        <h3>CASFOD</h3>
        <p>
          This project involved creating a solution to generate an Excel sheet
          with data collected from a dynamic form, aimed at easing Excel-related
          workload. I leveraged the ExcelJS library and Blob.js logic to prepare
          and download the file when the form is submitted. This project helped
          me practice and enhance my skills in form handling. Below is a screen
          shot of the dependencies and devDependencies used.
